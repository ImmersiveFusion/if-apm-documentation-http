# Persona: Immersion Enthusiast

## Profile

- **Role:** Developer/Architect interested in spatial computing and novel interfaces
- **Experience:** 5+ years, frustrated with traditional 2D dashboards
- **Context:** Seeking better ways to understand complex distributed systems

## Background

Has stared at Grafana dashboards and Jaeger traces for years. Knows there must be a better way to understand system topology and behavior. Interested in spatial interfaces - not necessarily VR headsets, but the concept of "being inside" the data. Wants to leverage spatial reasoning for debugging, not just pretty graphics.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "I don't want to wear a headset. Can I get the immersion benefits with just a monitor?"
- "Is 3D actually better or just different?"
- "How does 'being in the system' help me find a slow database query?"
- "Will this scale to our 500-service architecture?"
- "Can I navigate efficiently or will I get lost in 3D space?"

## What They Need

### To Understand
- What "immersion" means practically (not just VR)
- How spatial layout aids comprehension
- Desktop 3D vs VR differences
- Navigation and wayfinding in large systems
- Concrete examples of immersion helping

### To Adopt
- Clear benefit over 2D tools
- Efficient workflows (not slower than dashboards)
- Works with keyboard/mouse (VR optional)
- Scales to real-world complexity

## Critical Questions

1. "What can I understand 'immersed' that I can't from a 2D graph?"
2. "How do you handle a 500-node service graph without overwhelming me?"
3. "Can I use spatial memory to remember where services are?"
4. "What's the learning curve to navigate efficiently?"
5. "Is the 3D desktop mode a first-class experience or VR-lite?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I want immersion without VR. Convince me the desktop 3D mode delivers."
2. "Show me how spatial layout helps me understand a cascading failure."
3. "I have a massive microservices architecture. Will I get lost in 3D?"
4. "How do I quickly jump to a specific service instead of flying around?"
5. "What interaction patterns make 3D faster than clicking through dashboards?"

## Success Criteria

- Understands immersion beyond VR marketing
- Sees concrete cognitive benefits of spatial interface
- Can be productive with keyboard/mouse
- Finds value in 3D without headset
- Can explain benefits to skeptical colleagues

## Key Insight

This persona validates that IAPM's value proposition isn't "VR is cool" but rather "spatial understanding of complex systems improves comprehension" - which can be experienced on a regular monitor.
