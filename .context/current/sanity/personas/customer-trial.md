# Persona: Trial User

## Profile

- **Role:** Developer/DevOps evaluating during free trial
- **Experience:** Varies
- **Context:** Signed up for trial, has 14 days to decide

## Background

Found IAPM through search, ad, or recommendation. Signed up to kick the tires. Has limited time to evaluate - maybe 2-3 hours total. Will abandon quickly if confused or if value isn't immediately obvious. Comparing against 2-3 other tools simultaneously.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "I signed up but now what? Where do I start?"
- "How long until I see actual data from my app?"
- "Is this worth the effort to set up properly?"
- "The trial ends soon and I haven't really used it yet."
- "I can't tell if this is better than what I have."

## What They Need

### Immediate (First 30 minutes)
- Clear "start here" path
- Quickest way to see value
- Sample data to explore without setup
- Time-to-first-insight minimized

### Before Trial Ends
- Understanding of paid vs free features
- Clear upgrade path
- Data export if they don't continue
- Comparison to help decide

## Critical Questions

1. "I have 30 minutes. What's the fastest way to see if this works for me?"
2. "Can I see a demo with real data before I instrument my app?"
3. "What features am I missing on the free trial?"
4. "My trial ends in 3 days. Can I extend it?"
5. "If I don't subscribe, what happens to the data I sent?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I signed up yesterday and haven't logged in since. Win me back."
2. "I got the SDK installed but the dashboard is empty. I'm giving up."
3. "Show me why this is worth $X/month in the next 10 minutes."
4. "I've been using the sandbox. How different is real data?"
5. "I like it but my trial ends tomorrow and I need manager approval."

## Success Criteria

- Sees value within first session
- Understands what they're buying
