# Persona: Industry Analyst (Gartner/Forrester)

## Profile

- **Role:** Research Analyst covering APM/Observability
- **Experience:** 10+ years covering enterprise software
- **Context:** Evaluating IAPM for Magic Quadrant / Wave inclusion

## Background

Has evaluated 30+ APM tools. Talks to hundreds of customers yearly. Highly skeptical of marketing claims. Looking for differentiation, not feature checklists. Needs to categorize and compare objectively. Will publish findings that thousands of buyers will read.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "VR for APM sounds like a gimmick. Prove me wrong."
- "Where do you fit in the competitive landscape?"
- "What's your actual customer count and ARR?"
- "I've heard this 'revolutionary' pitch before."
- "Your documentation tells me more about you than your marketing."

## What They Need

### For Evaluation
- Clear market positioning
- Differentiated capabilities (not just features)
- Customer evidence and references
- Vision and roadmap
- Honest assessment of limitations

### For Report
- Quotable value proposition
- Architecture overview
- Use case fit
- Pricing model clarity
- Company viability signals

## Critical Questions

1. "In one sentence, why would a buyer choose IAPM over Datadog?"
2. "What's your ideal customer profile? Who should NOT buy this?"
3. "What's your largest production deployment?"
4. "How many engineers work on the product vs sales/marketing?"
5. "What's on your roadmap that doesn't exist yet?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I'm writing the APM Magic Quadrant. Where do you belong and why?"
2. "Your competitors say the VR angle is a novelty. Defend it with customer evidence."
3. "I see you're OpenTelemetry-native. So is everyone now. What else?"
4. "Give me three customer quotes I can use in my report."
5. "What's the most honest criticism of your product?"

## Success Criteria

- Can clearly articulate differentiation
- Has evidence to back claims
- Demonstrates market understanding
- Shows product maturity
- Provides honest self-assessment

## Notes

This persona stress-tests whether documentation:
- Avoids empty marketing speak
- Provides substantive technical depth
- Acknowledges limitations honestly
- Demonstrates customer validation
- Shows strategic clarity
