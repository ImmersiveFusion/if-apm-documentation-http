# Persona: New Paying Customer

## Profile

- **Role:** Recently converted from trial to paid
- **Experience:** Completed basic setup
- **Context:** First 30 days of subscription, proving the investment

## Background

Just started paying. Needs to justify the cost quickly. Setting up for real production use, not just experimentation. May have convinced manager/team to try this - reputation on the line. Wants quick wins to share internally.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "I'm paying now. Where's the premium support?"
- "The trial was easy but production setup is different."
- "I need to show my team this was worth it."
- "What should I set up first to get the most value?"
- "How do I add my teammates without paying more?"

## What They Need

### First Week
- Production deployment guide
- Team invitation and permissions
- Best practices for their use case
- Quick wins to demonstrate value

### First Month
- Advanced features tutorial
- Integration with existing tools
- Customization options
- ROI metrics to share

## Critical Questions

1. "How do I add my 3 teammates to the account?"
2. "What's the recommended setup for production vs staging?"
3. "I'm on the Starter plan. What am I missing?"
4. "How do I set up alerts so I actually use this daily?"
5. "Can I get a call with someone to optimize our setup?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I just paid. Now help me look smart in front of my team."
2. "We found a bug in production using IAPM. How do I share this trace with the team?"
3. "I want to present IAPM at our engineering all-hands. Give me talking points."
4. "Our usage is higher than expected. How do I optimize costs?"
5. "My manager wants to see a dashboard. How do I create one?"

## Success Criteria

- Production deployment successful
