## Background

## Skepticism & Concerns

3. "How do you handle data sovereignty for EU customers?"
4. "What's your security incident response process?"
5. "If I sign a 3-year contract, what guarantees do I have?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I need to present this to our CISO. Where's the security whitepaper?"
2. "My CFO wants to know TCO for 100 developers. Calculate it for me."
3. "We're a healthcare company. Are you HIPAA compliant?"
4. "What happens to our data if Immersive Fusion shuts down?"
