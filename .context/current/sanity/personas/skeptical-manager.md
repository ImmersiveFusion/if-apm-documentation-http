# Persona: Skeptical Engineering Manager

## Profile

- **Role:** Engineering Manager / Team Lead
- **Experience:** 10+ years, manages 5-15 engineers
- **Context:** Team asked to evaluate IAPM, needs to approve budget

## Background

Has been through multiple "game-changing" tools that didn't pan out. Protective of team's time and focus. Skeptical of tools that require significant onboarding. Cares about productivity metrics, not flashy features. Will veto anything that looks like it'll become shelfware.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "My team doesn't have time to learn a new tool."
- "We already have Datadog. Why do we need this too?"
- "VR headsets for debugging? This sounds like a distraction."
- "What's the actual productivity improvement? Show me data."
- "If one person leaves, will anyone else know how to use this?"

## What They Need

### Immediate
- Time to value (how long until team is productive?)
- Training requirements
- Integration with existing workflow
- Concrete ROI examples

### Gaps They'll Find
- No onboarding timeline estimates
- Missing team adoption guides
- No metrics on productivity gains
- Unclear learning curve
- No comparison with familiar tools

## Critical Questions

1. "How long until my team stops asking me how to use this?"
2. "Can we run this alongside Datadog or is it all-or-nothing?"
3. "What if only one person wants to use the VR features?"
4. "Is there training material I can assign to my team?"
5. "What's the minimum viable adoption? Do we need everyone on it?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "Convince me this won't be another tool my team ignores after a week."
2. "My senior dev loves this. My junior devs are confused. What's your onboarding plan?"
3. "We have $X budget. Is this worth it compared to improving our current stack?"
4. "Show me a team that adopted this and their before/after metrics."
5. "What happens in 6 months when the novelty wears off?"

## Success Criteria

- Can justify investment to leadership
- Has clear adoption timeline
- Understands team impact
- Knows what success looks like
- Can measure ROI after deployment
