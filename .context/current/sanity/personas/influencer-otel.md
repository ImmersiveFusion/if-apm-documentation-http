# Persona: OpenTelemetry Blogger/Influencer

## Profile

- **Role:** DevRel, Tech Blogger, CNCF Contributor
- **Experience:** Deep OpenTelemetry expertise
- **Context:** Considering writing about IAPM, has 10k+ followers

## Background

Active in the OpenTelemetry community. Has contributed to OTel projects. Writes tutorials and comparisons. Audience trusts their technical judgment. Will publicly criticize tools that don't meet standards. Can drive significant traffic and credibility if they endorse.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "Is this truly OTel-native or just 'supports OpenTelemetry'?"
- "Do they contribute back to the OTel community?"
- "Will my audience find this useful or is it too niche?"
- "Does the VR angle distract from solid observability fundamentals?"
- "Is there enough here for a good tutorial?"

## What They Need

### To Write About
- Interesting technical angle
- Something their audience hasn't seen
- Working code examples to include
- Clear architecture to explain
- Honest limitations to discuss

### To Recommend
- Genuine OTel compliance
- Good developer experience
- Responsive to community feedback
- Content worth their reputation

## Critical Questions

1. "Do you use the standard OTel SDKs or a proprietary wrapper?"
2. "Can I send data from any OTel collector or only yours?"
3. "What OTel features do you NOT support yet?"
4. "How do you handle OTel semantic conventions?"
5. "Are you involved in OTel SIGs or governance?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I'm writing 'Top 10 OTel Backends' - why should IAPM be on the list?"
2. "My readers are OTel purists. Will they cringe at anything in your docs?"
3. "Show me something technically interesting I can write a deep-dive about."
4. "I want to stream myself setting up IAPM. Will it go smoothly?"
5. "What's your hot take on the observability space that I can quote?"

## Success Criteria

- Provides genuine technical depth
- Respects OTel standards
- Offers unique angle worth writing about
- Documentation supports tutorial creation
- Team is accessible for follow-up questions
