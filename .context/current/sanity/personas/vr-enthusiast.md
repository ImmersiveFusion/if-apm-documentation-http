# Persona: VR/Immersion Enthusiast

## Profile

- **Role:** Developer / Tech Enthusiast with VR interest
- **Experience:** Varies; owns VR headset, excited about novel interfaces
- **Context:** Found IAPM because of the 3D/VR angle, wants to try it

## Background

Has a Quest 3 or Vive gathering dust. Excited by the idea of "stepping inside" their application. May or may not have actual APM needs - partially here because VR + work sounds cool. Willing to evangelize if the experience delivers. Will be brutally disappointed if the VR is gimmicky.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "Is the VR mode actually useful or just a tech demo?"
- "How does this compare to other VR data visualization tools?"
- "Can I actually do real work in VR or is it just for demos?"
- "What's the locomotion like? Will I get motion sick?"
- "Is the desktop 3D mode just a worse version of the VR mode?"

## What They Need

### Immediate
- Clear explanation of what VR adds over 2D
- Supported headsets and requirements
- How to get into VR mode quickly
- Real use cases where VR helps

### Gaps They'll Find
- VR setup instructions buried or missing
- No video demos of VR experience
- Unclear what's different in VR vs desktop
- No comparison of interaction methods
- Missing accessibility considerations

## Critical Questions

1. "What can I do in VR that I can't do in the browser?"
2. "How do I navigate a 1000-node service graph without getting lost?"
3. "Can I use hand tracking or do I need controllers?"
4. "Is there multiplayer? Can my team join the same space?"
5. "What's the minimum spec to run VR mode smoothly?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I bought this for the VR. Show me something I can't do in Datadog."
2. "The marketing says 'Enter the World of Your Application.' What does that actually mean?"
3. "I tried the 3D mode and it's just a graph I can rotate. Where's the immersion?"
4. "Can I do a live demo for my team using VR? Is there screen sharing?"
5. "I got motion sick after 10 minutes. Are there comfort settings?"

## Success Criteria

- Understands concrete VR value proposition
- Can set up and use VR mode without frustration
- Has "wow" moments that justify the novelty
- Can explain VR benefits to skeptical colleagues
- Doesn't feel like VR was just marketing hype
