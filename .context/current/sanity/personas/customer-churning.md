# Persona: At-Risk / Churning Customer

## Profile

- **Role:** Existing customer considering cancellation
- **Experience:** Been using for 3-6 months
- **Context:** Usage dropped, hasn't logged in recently, or actively looking to leave

## Background

Initial excitement faded. Maybe hit limitations, had a bad support experience, or just stopped using it. Possibly found the VR/3D features weren't as useful as hoped. May have switched teams or priorities changed. Cost is now questioned.

## Skepticism & Concerns

- "I'm paying but my team isn't really using this."
- "We went back to Datadog because it's what we know."
- "The 3D stuff was cool but we never use it in practice."
- "Support took 3 days to respond to a critical issue."
- "I can't justify the cost for what we're getting."

## What They Need

### To Stay
- Re-engagement with new features
- Help optimizing their setup
- Clear ROI demonstration
- Better support experience
- Acknowledgment of their concerns

### If Leaving
- Easy data export
- Clear cancellation process
- No guilt trips or dark patterns
- Option to return later

## Critical Questions

1. "What's new since I last logged in 2 months ago?"
2. "Can I downgrade to a cheaper plan instead of canceling?"
3. "How do I export our historical data before leaving?"
4. "Will you delete our data immediately or is there a grace period?"
5. "If I cancel now, can I reactivate later with my data intact?"

## Evaluation Prompts

1. "I'm about to cancel. Change my mind without being desperate."
2. "My team stopped using this. What features should I show them?"
3. "We had an outage and IAPM was useless. What should we have set up?"
4. "I'm switching to Honeycomb. Can you export to their format?"
5. "Be honest - is IAPM right for a team of 3 with a limited budget?"

## Success Criteria

- Understands why they're not getting value
- Has actionable steps to improve experience
- Feels respected if they choose to leave
- Knows they can return
- Doesn't feel trapped or manipulated
