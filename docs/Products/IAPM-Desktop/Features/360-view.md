# 360° Stack Visibility

Complete, real-time perspective of your entire system - from infrastructure to application behavior - all in one immersive environment. See how every layer interacts without losing context.

## Key Capabilities

### Unified System Understanding

See how infrastructure components interact with application behavior. Visualize the impact of infrastructure changes on your services and vice versa - all in one view.

### Cross-Layer Visibility

Trace issues across layers - from a failing service to the underlying infrastructure - without losing context or momentum. No more switching between separate infrastructure and application monitoring tools.

### Integrated Data

Logs, metrics, traces, and events are layered together in a single immersive view. Every data type is accessible in context, right where you need it.

## Industry Context

| Challenge | Industry Stat | Source |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Tool Sprawl | **87%** rely on multiple unintegrated tools | EMA |
| Monitoring Tools | Teams use **4.4 tools** on average | New Relic, 2025 |
| Context Switching | **5 weeks/year** lost switching between tools | Harvard Business Review |
| Outage Cost | **20-40%** spent just identifying impact | Ponemon Institute |

## What You Can See

### Application Layer

- Service topology and dependencies
- Request flows and latencies
- Error rates and exceptions
- Trace details and spans

### Infrastructure Layer

- Container and pod status
- Node health and resources
- Network connectivity
- Storage and compute metrics

### Data Layer

- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates
- Message queue depths
- Data flow patterns

## Benefits

### Faster Collaboration

Developers, SREs, support, and infrastructure teams all see the same live environment. No more "it works on my dashboard" - everyone shares the same perspective.

### Quicker Incident Response

During outages, immediately assess impact across all layers. See which infrastructure is affected, which services are degraded, and where the problem originates.

### Proactive Management

Spot bottlenecks, misconfigurations, and resource constraints before they impact users. The complete view reveals issues that siloed monitoring misses.

### Reduced Miscommunication

When everyone sees the same environment, discussions become more productive. Point to specific areas, share views, and reach consensus faster.

## Use Cases

### Incident Triage

When an alert fires, immediately see the full picture. Is it an application bug, infrastructure issue, or external dependency? The 360° view shows all factors at once.

### Capacity Planning

Visualize resource utilization across your entire stack. Identify which services need more resources and how infrastructure changes will affect application performance.

### Change Impact Analysis

Before deploying changes, understand the full scope of affected systems. After deployment, see the impact across all layers in real-time.

### Root Cause Analysis

Follow issues across layer boundaries. When a service fails, see whether it's caused by code, configuration, infrastructure, or dependencies - all in one view.

## Comparison

|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| View scope | Single layer | All layers unified |
| Context switching | Constant | None |
| Team alignment | Separate dashboards | Shared environment |
| Cross-layer analysis | Manual correlation | Automatic visualization |
