# Immersive APM for the Web & mobile


A web-based Application Performance Management ([APM](index.md)) solution is a type of APM software that is delivered over the internet and accessible through a web browser. A web-based APM solution provides a centralized view of application performance that can be accessed from any location with an internet connection.

APM solutions typically use a combination of monitoring agents, data collectors, and analytics tools to collect and analyze performance data. This data is then sent to a centralized dashboard or analytics tool that provides insights into application performance and identifies potential issues.

One of the key advantages of a web-based APM solution is its ease of use. Since the software is delivered over the internet, there is no need for complex installation or configuration processes. This makes it an ideal solution for organizations with limited IT resources or for those that need to monitor applications that are located in remote or distributed environments.

Another advantage of web-based APM solutions is their scalability. Since the software is hosted in the cloud, it can easily accommodate large volumes of performance data from multiple applications and IT infrastructure components. This makes it possible for organizations to monitor and manage the performance of their entire IT infrastructure from a single, centralized location.

Web-based APM solutions are also typically designed with user-friendly interfaces that make it easy for non-technical users to access and interpret performance data. This can help organizations to improve collaboration and communication between IT and business teams, and enable faster, more effective decision-making.
