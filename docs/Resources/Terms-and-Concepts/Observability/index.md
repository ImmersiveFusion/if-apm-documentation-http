# Observability

Observability framework is a set of practices and tools that enable software development and operations teams to gain visibility into complex systems, detect issues, and troubleshoot problems quickly. Observability is a key aspect of modern software development and operations, as it enables teams to monitor and manage the performance of applications and IT infrastructure in real-time.

## Logs, Metrics and Trace

The observability framework includes three main pillars: logs, metrics, and traces. 

* Logs refer to the detailed records of events and actions that occur within an application or IT infrastructure. 
* Metrics refer to quantitative measurements of application and infrastructure performance, such as response time, resource usage, and error rates.
* Traces refer to the end-to-end path of a transaction through a complex system, including all the services and components that are involved.

## Tools

Observability frameworks typically include a range of tools and techniques for collecting and analyzing telemetry data, such as monitoring agents, data collectors, analytics tools, and visualization dashboards. These tools are used to aggregate and analyze telemetry data from across the IT stack, and provide insights into application and infrastructure performance.

## Benefits

One of the key benefits of an observability framework is its ability to enable proactive monitoring and management of complex systems. By providing real-time visibility into application and infrastructure performance, observability frameworks can help teams detect and resolve issues before they impact users or cause downtime.

Observability frameworks also help to improve collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. By providing a shared view of application and infrastructure performance, observability frameworks can help teams work together more effectively, share insights, and develop solutions more quickly.

## Summary 
An observability framework is an essential component of modern software development and operations. By providing real-time visibility into application and infrastructure performance, observability frameworks can help organizations to improve the reliability, availability, and performance of their applications and IT infrastructure, and enable faster, more effective decision-making.
