# Service Level Agreement

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) describes Immersive Fusion's commitments regarding IAPM service availability, performance, and support response times.

## Service Availability

### Uptime Commitment

IAPM is designed for high availability. Our target uptime varies by subscription tier:

| Plan | Monthly Uptime Target | Maximum Monthly Downtime |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Starter | 99.5% | 3 hours 39 minutes |
| Professional | 99.9% | 43 minutes 50 seconds |
| Enterprise | 99.95% | 21 minutes 55 seconds |

### What Counts as Downtime

Downtime is measured when the IAPM platform is unavailable for normal use. This includes:

- Inability to ingest telemetry data
- Inability to access the IAPM Web interface
- Inability to connect via IAPM Desktop client

### Exclusions

The following are not counted as downtime:

- Scheduled maintenance (announced 48 hours in advance)
- Issues caused by customer's network or systems
- Force majeure events
- Features in beta or preview status

## Support Response Times

### Response Time Targets

| Severity | Description | Initial Response |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Critical** | Service completely unavailable | 1 hour |
| **High** | Major feature impaired, no workaround | 4 hours |
| **Medium** | Feature impaired with workaround available | 8 business hours |
| **Low** | General questions, minor issues | 24 business hours |

### Support Channels

| Channel | Availability | Best For |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Email | 24/7 | All inquiries |
| In-app chat | Business hours | Quick questions |
| Phone | Enterprise plans | Critical issues |

## Service Credits

If IAPM fails to meet the uptime commitment, eligible customers may request service credits:

| Monthly Uptime | Credit Percentage |
|----------------|-------------------|
| < 99.9% but ≥ 99.0% | 10% |
| < 99.0% but ≥ 95.0% | 25% |
| < 95.0% | 50% |

### Requesting Credits

To request a service credit:

1. Submit a request within 30 days of the incident
2. Include dates and times of the outage
3. Provide any relevant error messages or screenshots

Credits are applied to future invoices and do not exceed one month's subscription fee.

## Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Maintenance

- **Notification:** Minimum 48 hours advance notice
- **Timing:** Typically scheduled during low-usage periods
- **Duration:** Usually under 30 minutes

### Emergency Maintenance

In rare cases, emergency maintenance may be required without advance notice to address critical security issues or prevent service degradation.
