The Hall's design draws inspiration from the [Buzludja Monument](https://www.google.com/search?q=Buzludja+Monument){ target="_blank" }, reimagined for the digital age. Originally built in 1981, the monument's bold, futuristic architecture evokes ambition and grandeur. In its virtual incarnation, it transcends its origins to become a dynamic tribute to innovation, partnership, and forward-thinking.
