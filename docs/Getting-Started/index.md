# Getting Started

Get up and running with Immersive APM in minutes.

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Login Method

[Microsoft Entra ID (Office 365 / Azure)](Step-By-Step-Instructions/Entra-ID/index.md){:class="md-button md-button--primary"}
[Local or Social Account](Step-By-Step-Instructions/Local-and-Social/index.md){:class="md-button"}

Both options provide the same features and pricing. Choose based on your preferred authentication:

| Option | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Entra ID** | Organizations using Microsoft 365, Azure, or requiring SSO |
| **Local/Social** | Individual developers, Google/GitHub login, or non-Microsoft environments |

### 2. Create Your First Grid

After signing up, create a "grid" - your container for application telemetry data.

### 3. Instrument Your Application

Add [OpenTelemetry](../Resources/Terms-and-Concepts/Observability/Frameworks/OpenTelemetry/index.md) to your application and configure it with your API key. [View instrumentation guide →](../Setup/Custom-application/Instrument-your-application/index.md)

### 4. Explore Your Data

- **[IAPM Web](../Products/IAPM-Web/index.md)** - Browser-based dashboards and account management
- **[IAPM Desktop](../Products/IAPM/index.md)** - Full 3D visualization with optional VR support
