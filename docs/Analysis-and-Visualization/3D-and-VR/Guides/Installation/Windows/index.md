1. Allow Installation (if User Account Control is enabled)

    The installer file needs to make minimal modifications to your computer as part of the installation process as well as store Immersive APM for Windows files.

    If you have User Account Control enabled on your computer, ensure that the prompt displays `Verified publisher: Immersive Fusion LLC`. Click `Yes` once you have done so to allow the installer to make modifications to your computer. Click `No`, if you don't see such a message on the prompt and contact us for assistance. 

    !!! info "UAC"
        User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows operating systems that helps prevent unauthorized changes to your computer or device by notifying you when a program tries to make changes that require administrator-level permission. When UAC is enabled, it prompts you to confirm whether you want to allow the program to make the requested changes. This helps protect your computer from malware and other security threats.

    If you do not have `User Account Control` enabled on your computer, ensure that the installer file is digitally signed by Immersive Fusion. Contact us if you need assistance.
