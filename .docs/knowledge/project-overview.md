# Project Overview

## Project Identity

**Repository:** if-apm-documentation-http
**Purpose:** Official documentation website for Immersive APM
**Company:** Immersive Fusion LLC
**Published Site:** https://docs.immersivefusion.com
**GitHub:** https://github.com/ImmersiveFusion/if-apm-documentation-http

## What is Immersive APM?

Immersive APM is a cloud-native Application Performance Management (APM) solution that uses 3D and Virtual Reality technologies to visualize application telemetry data. The tagline "Enter the World of Your Application" captures the core innovation: transforming traditional 2D monitoring dashboards into immersive 3D/VR environments.

### Key Characteristics

- **Cloud-Native SaaS:** Fully managed APM service
- **OpenTelemetry-Based:** Built on industry-standard observability framework
- **Dual Client Models:**
  - Web/Mobile client (browser-based)
  - 3D/VR client (desktop application with VR headset support)
- **AI-Powered:** Includes GPT-based AI Copilot (latest versions)
- **Distributed Systems Focus:** Designed for microservices and complex architectures

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
1. **Software Engineers/Developers** - Implementing instrumentation and debugging
2. **DevOps/Operations Engineers** - Managing monitoring infrastructure
3. **Technical Decision Makers** - Evaluating APM solutions
4. **Early Adopters/Partners** - Beta testers and VR enthusiasts

### Required Knowledge
- Familiarity with APM and observability concepts
- Understanding of distributed systems
- Cloud infrastructure experience
- Development experience in .NET, Java, Python, Go, Node.js, etc.

## Products & Services

- **API Key Management:** For application instrumentation

## Value Proposition

Traditional APM tools display metrics, logs, and traces in 2D dashboards with charts and tables. Immersive APM introduces:

1. **3D Topology Visualization:** See your application architecture in 3D space
2. **VR Immersion:** Step inside your application's performance data
3. **Spatial Understanding:** Leverage human spatial reasoning for complex systems
4. **AI Assistance:** GPT-powered copilot for insights and guidance
5. **OpenTelemetry Standard:** No vendor lock-in, use industry standards
